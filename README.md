# Overview
An ASL AI-assistant to help the world learn sign language. This project was developed in effort of SJSU's CS161 "Software Project" course. For this course, we were required to implement some aspect of Machine Learning into this project. We decided to use a Convolutional Neural Network to power a real-time ASL Tutoring application.
